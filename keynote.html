  <p class="body">Dr. Zhong Lin (ZL) Wang is the Hightower Chair in Materials Science and Engineering and Regents' Professor at Georgia Tech, and Founding Director and Chief Scientist at Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and Nanosystems, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Dr. Wang has made original and innovative contributions to the synthesis, discovery, characterization and understanding of fundamental physical properties of oxide nanobelts and nanowires, as well as applications of nanowires in energy sciences, electronics, optoelectronics and biological science. His discovery and breakthroughs in developing nanogenerators establish the principle and technological road map for harvesting mechanical energy from environment and biological systems for powering a personal electronics. His research on self-powered nanosystems has inspired the worldwide effort in academia and industry for studying energy for micro-nano-systems. He coined and pioneered the field of piezotronics and piezo-phototronics. Dr. Wang was elected as a foreign member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2009, member of European Academy of Sciences in 2002, fellow of American Physical Society in 2005, fellow of AAAS in 2006, fellow of Materials Research Society in 2008, fellow of Microscopy Society of America in 2010, fellow of Royal Society of Chemistry, and fellow of the World Innovation Foundation in 2002. He received 2016 Distinguished Scientist Award from (US) Southeastern Universities Research Association, 2015 Thomas Routers Citation Laureate award, 2014 World Technology Prize in Materials; 2014 the James C. McGroddy Prize for New Materials from America Physical Society, 2011 MRS Medal from the Materials Research Society, 1999 Burton Medal from Microscopy Society of America. He has authored over 1100 peer reviewed journal articles (16 in Nature and Science, 16 in Nature sister journals). From SCI data base, his entire publications have been cited for over 100,000 times with an h-index of 155; Google scholar gives a citation of 150,000 with an h-index of 180.

  <p class="bold">Dr. Alexander Korsunsky</p><img src="../img/Korsunsky.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Alexander Korsunsky is Professor of Engineering Science at Trinity College, University of Oxford, where he is head of the Multi-Beam Laboratory for Engineering Microscopy (MBLEM). He is part of the Rolls-Royce University Technology Centre in Solid Mechanics. At the nearby Harwell Oxford Campus he heads the Centre for In situ Processing Studies (CIPS) in the Research Complex at Harwell. Each year Prof Korsunsky gives several keynote plenaries at major international conferences on engineering and materials. He maintains active international links, including visiting professorships at Universitá Roma Tre (Italy), ENSICAEN (France) and the National University of Singapore. Prof Korsunsky’s research interests concern developing improved understanding of integrity and reliability of engineered and natural structures and systems, from highperformance metallic alloys to polycrystalline ceramics to natural hard tissue such as human dentin and seashell nacre. Prof Korsunsky co-authored books on fracture mechanics (Springer) and elasticity (CUP), and published over 250 papers in scholarly periodicals on subjects ranging from neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis and the prediction of fatigue strength to micro-cantilever bio-sensors, size effects and scaling transitions in systems and structures. His h-index is 20, and his most cited paper 280. Support for Prof Korsunsky’s research has come from EPSRC and STFC, two major Research Councils in the UK, as well as from Rolls-Royce plc, Royal Society, Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng), NRF (South Africa), DFG (Germany), CNRS (France) and other international research foundations. Prof Korsunsky on the editorial board of Journal of Strain Analysis (SAGE and IMechE, UK). Prof Korsunsky is consultant to Rolls-Royce plc, the global aeroengine manufacturer, on company design procedures for reliability and consistency. He was seconded to their headquarters in Derby, UK (supported by RAEng), and advised on R&D in structural integrity. Prof Korsunsky plays a leading role in the development of large scale research facilities in the UK and Europe. At Diamond Light Source (DLS, Harwell Oxford, UK) he chaired the Science Advisory Committee and the User Working Group for beamline I12 JEEP (Joint Engineering, Environmental and Processing). He is member of UK delegation to ESRF Council. His activities expand the range of applications of large scale science to problems in real engineering practice. Prof Korsunsky’s research team at Oxford has members from almost every part of the globe (UK, FR, DE, IT, GR, China, India, Korea, Malaysia, South Africa).</p>
