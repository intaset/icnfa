  <p class="body">Albano Cavaleiro is Full Professor in the University of Coimbra, Portugal.
In 1990, he received a Ph.D. from Coimbra University on the field of
Mechanical Engineering, with a thesis on the surface modification of
materials by the sputtering deposition of thin coatings. Presently, he is
head of the research group "Surface Engineering Group" of Centre for
Mechanical Engineering Materials and Processes and head of LED&Mat at
Instituto Pedro Nunes.
His field of research and publications is very diversified as e.g. on
materials and surface engineering, structural transformations, deposition
and characterization of thin films, tribology, nanocrystalline /
nanocomposite materials. He participated in more than 40 research projects
from which he was responsible in more than 25. He was invited for talks in
about 40 international conferences on his field. He supervised 14 PhD
students and have an extensive evaluating activity for national and
international research agencies. He published more than 300 papers from
which about 270 in international journals of  SCI. He has more than 5500
citations and a H-index of 38 (Google Scholar).

  <p class="bold">Dr. Ralf Greiner</p><img src="../img/Greiner.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Ralf joined the Federal Research Centre for Nutrition, Karlsruhe, Germany in 1990 as a Ph.D. student after graduating in Chemistry at the University of Stuttgart. In the early steps of his career as Deputy Head of the Centre for Molecular Biology he was mainly engaged in research in respect to genetically modified food and enzyme for food processing, with phytases in the centre of his interests. In 2007 Ralf held a position as a Visiting Professor for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Department of Bioprocess Engineering, Federal University of Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil working on solid state fermentation and fungal enzyme production. In 2008 he returned to Karlsruhe where he became Head of the Department of Food Technology and Bioprocess Engineering of the Max Rubner-Institut (MRI). His research is focused on studying and modelling conventional and new processing technologies, as well as on food nanotechnology, but phytases are still in the focus of his interests. Ralf is a representative of MRI in several international and national associations on food technology, food control and food nanotechnology. In 2012 Ralf accepted the position as an Honorary Assistant Professor in the School of Biological Sciences of the University of Hong Kong. His research activities resulted in about 155 original papers in peer-reviewed journals, 45 book chapters and 280 abstracts or short papers in congress proceedings. Currently, Ralf also acts as Deputy to the President of the MRI. In addition, he is Editor for Food Control (Europe and South America). </p>

  <p class="body">The focus of the research activities in the area of food nanotechnology is on the one hand the establishment of analytical methods to characterise and visualise nanomaterials in complex matrices such as foods and beverages, digestion fluids and even within cells. On the other hand the development of food-grade micro- and nano-encapsulation systems for food components as so-called delivery or release systems (carbohydrate-, protein- and lipid-based). Encapsulation efficiencies, stability of the obtained micro- and nanoparticles under simulated gastro-intestinal conditions and release kinetics of the encapsulated compounds are under investigation. These studies are performed to increase knowledge about the effects of encapsulation on the stability of the encapsulated compounds during storage and digestion and the effects on bioavailability as well as on gut microflora. Interactions of nanomaterials with components and constituents of the food matrix is a further focus of research. In addition, strategies will be developed to study migration of nanoscale compounds from food contact materials such as food containers or food packaging to food.</p>

  <p class="body">Dr. Yoshinobu Baba received PhD degree in 1986 from Kyushu University.  After postdoctoral research, Assistant Professor at Oita University, and Associate Professor at Kobe Pharmaceutical University, he was promoted to the full professor at The University of Tokushima in 1997.  He was moved to Nagoya University in 2004.  He is now Professor of Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, School of Engineering, Professor of Department of Advanced Medical Science, School of Medicine, and a Director of ImPACT Research Center for Advanced Nanobiodevices, Nagoya University. He is also Guest Professor, Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo and ¬Research Supervisor, JST (Japan Science and Technology Agency) CREST “Elucidation of biological mechanism of extracellular fine particles and the control system” Project.  He is a co-initiator for the world largest Nanotech/Nanobio International Meeting and Exhibition.  He is a general chair of numerous international meetings (microTAS, MSB, NanoBioEXPO, ISMM).  He is an Associate Editor of Anal. Chem. of ACS and serving to over 15 scientific journals as an editorial/advisory board member.  He has been admitted as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry and received over 85 awards for his contributions in nanobiotechnology: MERCK Award in 2004, The CSJ (Chemical Society of Japan) award for creative work in 2008, The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry Award in 2015, and The Commendation for Science and Technology by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in 2016.  Dr. Baba’s research studies are directed at the development of nanobiodevices for omics, systems biology, medical diagnosis, tissue engineering, and molecular imaging. He is the author or co-author of 956 publications, including research papers, proceedings, reviews, and books and is also an inventor of over 100 patents. He has delivered more than 908 plenary and invited lectures at conferences. His work has been cited on 405 occasions by newspapers and television. </p>

  <p class="bold">Dr. Aimin Song</p><img src="../img/Song.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Professor Aimin Song obtained BSc degree in Physics at Shandong University in 1989, followed by MSc and PhD degrees at the Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1992 and 1995. He spent prestigious fellowships at Glasgow University and Munich University from the Royal Society and Alexander von Humboldt foundation. After working at Lund University as a Guest Lecturer, he moved to University of Manchester as a Lecturer in 2002 and was promoted to Professor of Nanoelectronics in 2006. Professor Song has 18 patents and patent applications on novel electronic nano-device concepts, of which 10 have been granted and 3 at PCT stage. Two EU Framework Program projects have been centered on the ultra-fast nanodevice concepts that he developed. One of the devices has worked at 1.5 THz (1THz=1,000GHz), which is a record speed of electronic nanodevice to date. The applicability of the new devices in printed flexible electronics has led to a spin out company. He received a Royal Society Brian Mercer Feasibility Award, and was awarded a Distinguished Achievement Medal for “<i>Researcher of the Year</i>” of the University of Manchester in 2007. His research has been published in Nature Communications, Physical Review Letters, NanoLetters, Nanoscale, etc, and he has contributed over 50 invited conference talks and chapters for four books. </p>
