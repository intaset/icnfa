  <p class="body">Dr. Devika Chithrani is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University of Victoria and also part of the medical physics faculty in British Columbia Cancer Agency, Victoria, Canada. She is also an iBEST research scientist at Li Ka Shing Knowledge institute, St. Michael hospital, Toronto. She was a recipient of the prestigious Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) doctoral award and NSERC post-doctoral award during her graduate and post-graduate studies at university of Toronto, Canada. She was the recipient of the Physics Gold medal and Faculty Gold medal at her undergraduate convocation.
As the director of the Nanoscience and Technology development Laboratory, Dr. Chithrani leverages nanotechnology to create innovations that advance the care of cancer patients. She is using gold nanoparticles as a radiation dose enhancer in cancer therapy. In addition, she is improving the control we have over highly toxic anticancer drugs used in chemotherapy by developing gold nanostructures and testing their intracellular effect. She was able to show for the first time that gold nanoparticles can be used as a radiation dose enhancer at clinically relevant MeV energies. This work was featured on the cover of the Journal of Radiation Research. She has been on expert panels at both ASTRO (Largest radiation oncology conference) and AAPM (Largest medical physics conference) to discuss the road map to clinical translation of gold-mediated radiosensitization. She has developed three dimensional tumor models to optimize use of nanotechnology in cancer therapy. This work was featured on the cover of Nano-Micro Letters journal. Dr. Chithrani is considered as one of the leaders in the field of nanotechnology and her publications have received over 6000 citations in few years. She is currently directing two Nanoscience and Technology Development Laboratories in Toronto and Victoria in Canada. Dr. Chithrani has earned a strong international reputation for her innovative research through her many review articles, book chapters, and invited presentations. She is an associate editor of many nanotechnology based journals. Her passion is to develop smart nanomaterials to improve exiting cancer therapeutics. She believes that many side effects due to chemotherapy can be reduced by controlled delivery of anticancer drugs using smart nanomaterials.  The improved delivery of cancer therapeutics will reduce health care cost worldwide while improving the quality of life of cancer patients.
