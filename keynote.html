  <p class="body">Dr. Devika Chithrani is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University of Victoria and also part of the medical physics faculty in British Columbia Cancer Agency, Victoria, Canada. She is also an iBEST research scientist at Li Ka Shing Knowledge institute, St. Michael hospital, Toronto. She was a recipient of the prestigious Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) doctoral award and NSERC post-doctoral award during her graduate and post-graduate studies at university of Toronto, Canada. She was the recipient of the Physics Gold medal and Faculty Gold medal at her undergraduate convocation.</p>
  <p class="body">As the director of the Nanoscience and Technology development Laboratory, Dr. Chithrani leverages nanotechnology to create innovations that advance the care of cancer patients. She is using gold nanoparticles as a radiation dose enhancer in cancer therapy. In addition, she is improving the control we have over highly toxic anticancer drugs used in chemotherapy by developing gold nanostructures and testing their intracellular effect. She was able to show for the first time that gold nanoparticles can be used as a radiation dose enhancer at clinically relevant MeV energies. This work was featured on the cover of the Journal of Radiation Research. She has been on expert panels at both ASTRO (Largest radiation oncology conference) and AAPM (Largest medical physics conference) to discuss the road map to clinical translation of gold-mediated radiosensitization. She has developed three dimensional tumor models to optimize use of nanotechnology in cancer therapy. This work was featured on the cover of Nano-Micro Letters journal. Dr. Chithrani is considered as one of the leaders in the field of nanotechnology and her publications have received over 6000 citations in few years. She is currently directing two Nanoscience and Technology Development Laboratories in Toronto and Victoria in Canada. Dr. Chithrani has earned a strong international reputation for her innovative research through her many review articles, book chapters, and invited presentations. She is an associate editor of many nanotechnology based journals. Her passion is to develop smart nanomaterials to improve exiting cancer therapeutics. She believes that many side effects due to chemotherapy can be reduced by controlled delivery of anticancer drugs using smart nanomaterials.  The improved delivery of cancer therapeutics will reduce health care cost worldwide while improving the quality of life of cancer patients.

  <p class="bold">Dr. Ralf Greiner</p><img src="../img/Greiner.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Ralf joined the Federal Research Centre for Nutrition, Karlsruhe, Germany in 1990 as a Ph.D. student after graduating in Chemistry at the University of Stuttgart. In the early steps of his career as Deputy Head of the Centre for Molecular Biology he was mainly engaged in research in respect to genetically modified food and enzyme for food processing, with phytases in the centre of his interests. In 2007 Ralf held a position as a Visiting Professor for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Department of Bioprocess Engineering, Federal University of Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil working on solid state fermentation and fungal enzyme production. In 2008 he returned to Karlsruhe where he became Head of the Department of Food Technology and Bioprocess Engineering of the Max Rubner-Institut (MRI). His research is focused on studying and modelling conventional and new processing technologies, as well as on food nanotechnology, but phytases are still in the focus of his interests. Ralf is a representative of MRI in several international and national associations on food technology, food control and food nanotechnology. In 2012 Ralf accepted the position as an Honorary Assistant Professor in the School of Biological Sciences of the University of Hong Kong. His research activities resulted in about 155 original papers in peer-reviewed journals, 45 book chapters and 280 abstracts or short papers in congress proceedings. Currently, Ralf also acts as Deputy to the President of the MRI. In addition, he is Editor for Food Control (Europe and South America). </p>

  <p class="body">The focus of the research activities in the area of food nanotechnology is on the one hand the establishment of analytical methods to characterise and visualise nanomaterials in complex matrices such as foods and beverages, digestion fluids and even within cells. On the other hand the development of food-grade micro- and nano-encapsulation systems for food components as so-called delivery or release systems (carbohydrate-, protein- and lipid-based). Encapsulation efficiencies, stability of the obtained micro- and nanoparticles under simulated gastro-intestinal conditions and release kinetics of the encapsulated compounds are under investigation. These studies are performed to increase knowledge about the effects of encapsulation on the stability of the encapsulated compounds during storage and digestion and the effects on bioavailability as well as on gut microflora. Interactions of nanomaterials with components and constituents of the food matrix is a further focus of research. In addition, strategies will be developed to study migration of nanoscale compounds from food contact materials such as food containers or food packaging to food.</p>

  <p class="bold">Dr. Daisuke Onoshima</p><img src="../img/Onoshima.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Dr. Daisuke Onoshima is an associate professor at Institute of Innovation for Future Society at Nagoya University. Dr. Onoshima received his Ph.D. in Applied Chemistry from Nagoya University. Following his postdoctoral research in Creation of Innovation Centers for Advanced Interdisciplinary Areas Program by Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and Funding Program for World-Leading Innovative R&amp;D on Science and Technology by Japan Cabinet Office, he joined Center of Innovation Program by MEXT and moved to Institute of Innovation for Future Society, the newly organized institute for business-academia collaboration at Nagoya University. His research field is separation science based on lab-on-a-chip technology. Specifically, Dr. Onoshima’s work aims toward cancer diagnostics and bacteriological testing. Dr. Onoshima was recently accepted as a member of Program for Creating STart-ups from Advanced Research and Technology by Japan Science and Technology Agency (START), aiming for the establishment of a Japanese-Style innovation ecosystem by combining public funding and private sector commercialization knowhow. </p>

  <div class="keynote-info">
  <p class="bold">Dr. Aimin Song</p><img src="../img/Song.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Professor Aimin Song obtained BSc degree in Physics at Shandong University in 1989, followed by MSc and PhD degrees at the Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1992 and 1995. He spent prestigious fellowships at Glasgow University and Munich University from the Royal Society and Alexander von Humboldt foundation. After working at Lund University as a Guest Lecturer, he moved to University of Manchester as a Lecturer in 2002 and was promoted to Professor of Nanoelectronics in 2006. Professor Song has 18 patents and patent applications on novel electronic nano-device concepts, of which 10 have been granted and 3 at PCT stage. Two EU Framework Program projects have been centered on the ultra-fast nanodevice concepts that he developed. One of the devices has worked at 1.5 THz (1THz=1,000GHz), which is a record speed of electronic nanodevice to date. The applicability of the new devices in printed flexible electronics has led to a spin out company. He received a Royal Society Brian Mercer Feasibility Award, and was awarded a Distinguished Achievement Medal for “<i>Researcher of the Year</i>” of the University of Manchester in 2007. His research has been published in Nature Communications, Physical Review Letters, NanoLetters, Nanoscale, etc, and he has contributed over 50 invited conference talks and chapters for four books. </p>
