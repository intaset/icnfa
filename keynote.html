  <p class="bold">Dr. Luigi Falciola</p><img src="../img/Falciola.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Luigi Falciola graduated in Chemistry in 1998 and received his PhD degree in Chemical Sciences in 2002. He is now Associate Professor in Analytical Chemistry at the Chemistry Department of the Università degli Studi di Milano (Italy), where he founded and leads the ELAN (ELectroANalytical Chemistry) Group.</p>
  <p class="body">The Group is devoted to the development, the characterization and the application of electroanalytical methods, together with the comprehension of the kinetics and mechanism of electrode processes with particular attention to the important roles of the electrode material and the solvent media. The main research interests are related to the development of new electroanalytical methodologies (particularly those based on voltammetric pulsed and stripping techniques) and new electrode materials (modified electrodes and composites, ink-jet printed and screen-printed electrodes) to be used for different applications in the fields of sensors, the environmental analysis and of the quality control of different products (water, foodstuff, drugs, ...). In this context, the group is continually producing new electroanalytical sensors based on electrodes modified particularly with nanostructured materials (carbon nanotubes, graphene, metal or oxide nanoparticles) and/or conducting or non-conducting polymers, in order to improve their analytical performances or to detect completely new analytes, such as compounds of emerging concern (CEC).</p>
  <p class="body">Luigi Falciola is Member of the International Society of Electrochemistry (ISE), of the Italian Chemical Society (Electrochemistry Division Secretary and Treasurer from 2011 to 2016 and Sensors Group Steering Committee Member), of the Royal Society of Chemistry (Italy Local Section Treasurer). He is author and co-author of 75 scientific papers in peer reviewed International Journals.
For further information, you can visit the Group website (<a href="http://users.unimi.it/ELAN" class="body-link">http://users.unimi.it/ELAN</a>) where a complete list of Publications can also be found.</p>
