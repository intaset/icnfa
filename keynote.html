  <p class="body">Albano Cavaleiro is Full Professor in the University of Coimbra, Portugal.
In 1990, he received a Ph.D. from Coimbra University on the field of
Mechanical Engineering, with a thesis on the surface modification of
materials by the sputtering deposition of thin coatings. Presently, he is
head of the research group "Surface Engineering Group" of Centre for
Mechanical Engineering Materials and Processes and head of LED&Mat at
Instituto Pedro Nunes.
His field of research and publications is very diversified as e.g. on
materials and surface engineering, structural transformations, deposition
and characterization of thin films, tribology, nanocrystalline /
nanocomposite materials. He participated in more than 40 research projects
from which he was responsible in more than 25. He was invited for talks in
about 40 international conferences on his field. He supervised 14 PhD
students and have an extensive evaluating activity for national and
international research agencies. He published more than 300 papers from
which about 270 in international journals of  SCI. He has more than 5500
citations and a H-index of 38 (Google Scholar).

  <p class="bold">Dr. Devika Chithrani</p><img src="../img/Chithrani.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Dr. Chithrani did her bachelor of science at University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. She did a physics major and received a first class honors along with many other awards which includes the gold medal for faculty of science and  gold medal for physics. She also received a probationary lecturer position based on her academic excellence. Recognizing her achievements, University of Toronto awarded her a scholarship to do her doctoral studies. During her doctoral studies at the department of Materials science and Engineering, she won many prestigious awards including NSERC, OGS, OGGST, and university of Toronto open scholarship.  She also received an NSERC-PDF to carry on her postdoctoral work at institute of Biomedical engineering, University of Toronto. Currently, she is the director of the Nanoscience and Technology Development Laboratory at the department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Victoria, Canada. Dr. Chithrani leverages nanotechnology to create innovations that advance the care of cancer patients. She is using gold nanoparticles as a radiation dose enhancer in cancer therapy. This work is featured on the cover of radiation research journal. This paper won the highest impact paper award in 2018 by COMP (Canadian association of Medical physicist). She has also developed three dimensional tumor models to optimize bio-nano interface in cancer therapy. This work is featured on the cover of Nano-Micro Letters. Dr. Chithrani is considered as one of the leaders in the field of nanotechnology and her publications have received over 7500 citations in few years. Dr. Chithrani has earned a strong international reputation for her innovative research through her many review articles, book chapters, and invited presentations. She is an associate editor of many nanotechnology based journals. Her passion is to develop smart nanomaterials to improve exiting cancer therapeutics. She believes that many side effects due to chemotherapy can be reduced by controlled delivery of anticancer drugs using smart nanomaterials. </p>

  <p class="bold">Dr. Aimin Song</p><img src="../img/Song.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Professor Aimin Song obtained BSc degree in Physics at Shandong University in 1989 and MSc and PhD degrees at the Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1992 and 1995. After prestigious fellowships from the Royal Society and Alexander von Humboldt foundation at Glasgow University and Munich University, he was a Guest Lecturer at Lund University before moving to University of Manchester as a Lecturer in 2002. He was promoted to Professor of Nanoelectronics in 2006. Professor Song has over 30 patents and patent applications on novel electronic nano-device concepts. He received a Royal Society Brian Mercer Feasibility Award and was awarded a Distinguished Achievement Medal for “Researcher of the Year” of the University of Manchester in 2007. His research has been published in Nature Communications, Physical Review Letters, PNAS, NanoLetters, Nanoscale, etc, and contributed over 70 invited/plenary talks at international conferences.
