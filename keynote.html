  <p class="body">Masami Furuuchi is Professor of School of Environmental Design, College of Science and Engineering, Kanazawa University, Japan. He is the head of Atmospheric Environment and Pollution Control Engineering Laboratory, who graduated master course in Toyohashi University of Technology, Japan in 1983 and received a Doctor’s degree of Engineering in chemical engineering from Nagoya University, Japan in 1990. He is also a member of the biomass utilization division of the Research center of Sustainable Energy and Technology (RSET) of Kanazawa University. He was a visiting scientist of University of Duisburg, Germany in 1996-1997. He has been also a visiting scientist at University of Iowa in USA (1983), University of Maryland in USA (2000), University of Cincinnati in USA (2000) and University of Vienna in Austria (2014). He is an editorial board member of Aerosol and Air Quality Research (AAQR) from 2008. His research has been so far focused on measurement and mechanical separation of particles on their morphology, dust cleaning technologies, instrumentation of devises for collection and monitoring of nanoparticles and their application to environmental monitoring and source apportionment of environmental aerosol nanoparticles as well as nanomaterial processes. More than 10 years of ambient nanoparticle monitoring in Angkor Monument Park, Cambodia from 2005 has been conducted by his group as an official collaboration with the APSARA National Authority, which exclusively manages the Park Area. From 2013, he is the organizer of the East Asia Nanoparticle Monitoring Network (EA-Nanonet), which consists of 18 universities and institutes from 8 different countries and has purposes on monitoring and characterization of ambient aerosol nanoparticles in this area. Other than the instrumentation for nanoparticles, recent research interests are also on environmental loads related to agriculture and agro-industries, characteristics of nano-particles emitted from biomass burning, online characterization of bio-aerosol. About 70 articles published in peer reviewed journals, more than 100 presentations in international conferences, 2 registered patents on nanoparticle separation, 2 chapters of books on dust cleaning. Many international research projects on ambient nanoparticle monitoring in collaboration with universities in Thailand, Cambodia, China and Austria.</p>

  <p class="body">Alexander Korsunsky is Professor of Engineering Science at Trinity College, University of Oxford, where he is head of the Multi-Beam Laboratory for Engineering Microscopy (MBLEM). He is part of the Rolls-Royce University Technology Centre in Solid Mechanics. At the nearby Harwell Oxford Campus he heads the Centre for In situ Processing Studies (CIPS) in the Research Complex at Harwell. Each year Prof Korsunsky gives several keynote plenaries at major international conferences on engineering and materials. He maintains active international links, including visiting professorships at Universitá Roma Tre (Italy), ENSICAEN (France) and the National University of Singapore. Prof Korsunsky’s research interests concern developing improved understanding of integrity and reliability of engineered and natural structures and systems, from highperformance metallic alloys to polycrystalline ceramics to natural hard tissue such as human dentin and seashell nacre. Prof Korsunsky co-authored books on fracture mechanics (Springer) and elasticity (CUP), and published over 250 papers in scholarly periodicals on subjects ranging from neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis and the prediction of fatigue strength to micro-cantilever bio-sensors, size effects and scaling transitions in systems and structures. His h-index is 20, and his most cited paper 280. Support for Prof Korsunsky’s research has come from EPSRC and STFC, two major Research Councils in the UK, as well as from Rolls-Royce plc, Royal Society, Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng), NRF (South Africa), DFG (Germany), CNRS (France) and other international research foundations. Prof Korsunsky on the editorial board of Journal of Strain Analysis (SAGE and IMechE, UK). Prof Korsunsky is consultant to Rolls-Royce plc, the global aeroengine manufacturer, on company design procedures for reliability and consistency. He was seconded to their headquarters in Derby, UK (supported by RAEng), and advised on R&D in structural integrity. Prof Korsunsky plays a leading role in the development of large scale research facilities in the UK and Europe. At Diamond Light Source (DLS, Harwell Oxford, UK) he chaired the Science Advisory Committee and the User Working Group for beamline I12 JEEP (Joint Engineering, Environmental and Processing). He is member of UK delegation to ESRF Council. His activities expand the range of applications of large scale science to problems in real engineering practice. Prof Korsunsky’s research team at Oxford has members from almost every part of the globe (UK, FR, DE, IT, GR, China, India, Korea, Malaysia, South Africa).</p>
